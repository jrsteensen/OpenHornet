# Masks file name abbreviations

To navigate within the Masks directory, you'll need to start by identifying the OH Part Number (PN) of the knobs you're seeking the mask for. Once you have the OH Part Number (PN) in hand, locate the corresponding subfolder within the Masks directory that contains this part number in its name.
For further clarification, the abbreviations used in file names are explained below.
