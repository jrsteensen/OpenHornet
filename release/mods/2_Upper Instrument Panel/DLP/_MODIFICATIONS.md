## OH1A8A1A-27-01 - UFC Square Button - 1 to OH1A8A1A-27-20 - UFC Square Button - ONOFF
### 04.12.19 by Balse
- Those parts are intended to be printed on a DLP printer.
- Combined original UFC square button with the according legend plates.
- Made the legend text engraving depth deeper, so it can better hold engraving paint.

## OH1A8A1A-28 - UFC Round Button
### 04.12.19 by Balse
- Those parts are intended to be printed on a DLP printer.
- Combined original UFC round button with the legend plate.
- Made the legend engraving depth deeper, so it can better hold engraving paint.

## OH1A8A2A-13 - HUD Panel Legend Plate
### 04.12.19 by Balse

- Those parts are intended to be printed on a DLP printer.
- Split the plate in two parts so it fits into an Anycubic Photon.
- Made the legend engraving depth deeper, so it can better hold engraving paint.

## OH1A3A-11 - DDI Button
### 05.12.19 by Balse
- Part is intended to be printed on a DLP printer.
- Deepen and widen the groove in the button. It can better hold engraving paint, or in my case a vinyl sticker.

## OH1A3A-18 - DDI MS21382-0XBX & OH1A3A-19 - DDI MS21382-0XNX
### 05.12.19 by Balse
- Part is intended to be printed on a DLP printer.
- Modified the shaft cutout so that the rotary button press fits onto the electronic part (Worked for me on an Anycubic Photon. Since the tolerances are different for every printer, this might not work for you).
