# **ECAD DIRECTORY INFORMATION**

The purpose of this ReadMe is to help enable the end-user to successfully navigate the file structure as well as provide clarification regarding the manufacturing process of PCB's related to OpenHornet.

## ECAD File Structure

The ECAD Directory has been organized to facilitate the end user, regardless of skill or knowledge, in acquiring the necessary files needed to: 
* A: make adjustments to individual PCB's as needed using ECAD software (KiCad)
     * _and/or_
* B: submit an online order to have the PCB manufactured and assembled by a company.


**The ECAD Directory is structured below:**
   * PCBs  
     * ABSIS
     * OH_Specific
        * Backlighting
        * Non_Backlighting
        * Functional
   * 
* DOCs
* Interconnects
* Lib

* Within each labled PCB folder, there will be a folder called "Manufacturing Files." 
* The "Manufacturing Files" folder will have a .zip file containing the gerber (.gbr) files required during the intial upload process during step 1.
* There will also be a excel spreadsheet labaled "Name_of_PCB_BOM.xlsx" that will contain the required Bill of Materials needed during the assembly process.
* There will be two more CSV files labeled "Name_of_PCB_top_pos.csv" and "Name_of_PCB_bottom_pos.csv" that is uploaded to show the precise location that the components (listed in the BOM) 
	need to be placed.


## PCB Manufacturing

At the moment, all PCB's are being standardized to allow for fabrication using JLCPCB (https://www.jlcpcb.com).  You may use another PCB manufacturer of your choosing, however, you'll be
responsible for ensuring the required files meet their specifications and formatting.  (I.E:  BOM and CPL files)

The ECAD Directory has been organized to facilitate the end user in acquiring the necessary files needed to submit a request online for PCB fabrication.
