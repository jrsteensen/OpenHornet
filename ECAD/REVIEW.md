Sometimes we might want to take a quick look to schematics directly on github.
Sadly, Github doesn't natively support kicad file previews. However, there are
tools which can help with reviewing changes without pulling the changes and opening
using kicad. For example:

https://kicanvas.org/

This tool works well with schematics but it will fail to open most OpenHornet PCBs due dependencies.
