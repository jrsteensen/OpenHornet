the "dimmer" function is used to control an external light slaved by the DCS data.



Example :

DcsBios::Dimmer dashPanelLight(0x3022, PIN);




"PIN" must be a PWM output of the arduino card.

!! Arduino board cannot provide enough current to control several LEDs. !!

Use an external mount to control several LEDs.
